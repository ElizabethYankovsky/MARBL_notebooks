These represent different choices one can make for the vertical parameterizations ([more info in the MOM6 docs](https://mom6.readthedocs.io/en/main/parameterizations_vertical.html)). I suggest starting with the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP), which is a traditionally used scheme. This is the one that I've been working with for now."

My recommendation is to leave the single_column directory intact and make your own copy of that directory that you'll be working with and modifying; for examle, I've created **/glade/u/home/eyankovsky/MOM6-examples/ocean_only/my_single_column/**. Within that is the KPP directory that I've been performing simulations in (feel free to look at that!).\n"

    "4. Once you're inside of the KPP directory, you can make modifications to **MOM_input** or **MOM_override** to control various aspects of your run. I'm happy to help out with this. Here are a few changes I made. Again, you can see all of this in the directory **/glade/u/home/eyankovsky/MOM6-examples/ocean_only/my_single_column/KPP**.\n",
    "- In **MOM_override** I set CESM_INPUTDIR = \"INPUT/BATS\" (this is where I place all of the initial conditions for the MARBL tracers)\n",
    "- I've been running the single column experiment for the [BATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Atlantic_Time-series_Study#:~:text=The%20Bermuda%20Atlantic%20Time%2Dseries,N%2064%C2%B010%E2%80%B2W%20.) location. In order to do this, one has to first create the initial condition files for the MARBL tracers that correspond to that location. I do this in the Generate_IC_Files.ipynb [here](https://github.com/ElizabethYankovsky/MARBL_notebooks/blob/master/Generate_IC_Files.ipynb). Once you run the model, it will generate an initial state filed called **MOM_IC.nc** that you can compare against your own initial condition file to make sure the model is initialized properly, this is done in Check_MARBL_initialization.ipynb.\n",
    "- I changed the file **diag_table** to save all of the MARBL tracer information (you can copy what I have there)\n",
